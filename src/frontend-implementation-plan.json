Update the container/grid structure so the remaining headline/copy/stat cards occupy the available width cleanly (e.g., switch to a single-column layout at all breakpoints, or reconfigure the grid so there is no empty column), maintaining good spacing, alignment, and responsiveness on mobile and desktop."
