# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove Vivan Pathak’s portrait photo from the top Hero section while keeping the Hero layout visually balanced and responsive.

**Planned changes:**
- Stop rendering the Hero `<img>` currently sourced from `/assets/generated/vivan-hero.dim_1200x1500.jpg`.
- Adjust the Hero section layout/styles so headline, copy, and stat cards remain cleanly laid out and responsive on mobile and desktop without an empty/awkward column.
- Ensure no other sections (Highlights, Aircraft photo section, modals, footer) are affected by the Hero layout change.

**User-visible outcome:** The homepage Hero no longer shows Vivan’s portrait photo, and the remaining Hero content is centered/readable and looks balanced across screen sizes.
